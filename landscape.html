            <div class="title">Berlin Colloquium on Landscape (Proposal)</div>

            <p>The perpetual extension of the human perceptual system, driven by innovation of sensor technology, raises questions about the evolving role of landscape as a mode of inquiry in art. In particular, the direct encounter with physical space is
                undermined by our technological distance from the frontiers of the human environment.
            </p>

            <p>Although depiction of terrain has traditionally served as a mirror of mind, physical sensation is now mediated by non-human actors. In avoidance of bias, scientific representations of space are in fact designed to diffuse the authorship of
                the human agent. By contrast, inquiry through art is predicated on human experience.

            </p>
            <p>It is unclear what implications the artist’s presence has outside tangible spacetime. The artist (and therefore the viewer) acts as interloper, while the exposure of alien dimensions alters their natural perception.

            </p>
            <p>Although artists have experimented with found sensor data, such work is bound to the research process that generated the information. The artist must find ways to retain presence and agency in an increasingly systematized process of sensing.
                One can deconstruct existing data to create open spatial models, commandeer existing technology, or develop independent sensor systems designed to address aesthetic queries. However, it remains difficult to extricate the process from scientific
                methodology.
            </p>

            <p>A two-day colloquium will convene 10-12 artists who are facing these questions in their practice. Participants will be selected from among NYU Global Network faculty, art faculty at European institutions (e.g. UdK, Goldsmiths), and independent artists. The meetings will be held at one of the two NYU Berlin sites, or in a partner space selected in collaboration with the site’s Director. As a center for advanced research in both art and science, Berlin is uniquely
                suited to serve as the context for this conversation. Nonetheless, some affordance will be made to selected NYU faculty and researchers who are only able to participate remotely.

            </p>
            <p>Presentation, discussion and research sharing will be structured to guide the creation of a book formalizing the outcomes of the meeting, to be edited and published by Winer-Karwas in New York. Following the event, the group will present their work to a
                public audience in Berlin, with a focus on attendance by local NYU students and faculty.
