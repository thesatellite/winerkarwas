            <p>A two-day meeting in Berlin will convene a group of artists to re-examine landscape as a mode of inquiry in art.
  </p>

            <p>As technology continues to develop, it expands our perception of spatial reality and thereby provides new subject matter for aesthetic questions. Yet how does the artist remain present when reality is experienced through data?

            </p>
            <p>Through scientific attempts to further understand space and time, technological progress has enabled us to gather previously unavailable imagery at nearly any scale of time or distance—at extreme resolution, across various spectrums, remotely, and passively. These methods of gathering, however, remove any context from the act of seeing. In fact, they are designed to avoid human influence. Consequently, there is a reduced point of view and too much distance, offering the viewer a scant connection to reality. In order to fully understand this new information, we turn to the embodied and individual perception of the artist.


            </p>
            <p>Although artists have created images from scientific data, the context of the work is generally limited by the research that generated the underlying information. The perspective, or even the image itself, is created without the interaction of the artist.
            </p>

            <p>In order to reclaim a context of <i>plein air</i> – a direct, personal experience of the physical world – the artist must have presence and agency in the process of data collection. This can be addressed by commandeering existing technology, developing independent sensor systems, or by deconstructing existing information to create open data models for the artist to explore.

            </p>
            <p>Subjectivity is central to our understanding of the world, and has long been the blueprint for the next wave of understanding and progress. As inaccessible landscapes and hidden dimensions continue to become meaningful frontiers, it is essential to consider the role of art in the interpretive process.
    </p>
    <p>  Discussion and research sharing among the participants will be structured to guide the creation of a book, formalizing the outcomes of the encounter, and setting the groundwork for wider dialogue and research on the role of art in environmental perception. Participants will contribute content and editorial ideas throughout the process, and layouts will be developed in real-time, resulting in a preliminary edit at the conclusion of the meeting.
</p>
          <div class="subtitle" style="margin-top:40px;">Call for Participants</div>
