<p>Join an experiment in art-making and education. We are inviting a group of students, from diverse disciplines and origins, to participate fully and freely in our work.</p>
<p>Explore a simple, expansive question: what is the world around us? Find unknown dimensions of environmental reality through new techniques of image making, employing structural framing, environmental sensing, and visual output.</p>
<p>Apprentices will assist in the ideation and production of this work, and will participate in theoretical and practical education through workshops and seminars.  The apprenticeship has no fixed location and meetings will be conducted online.</p>
<p>Each apprenticeship will have a three month duration and will require 2 hours of meetings each week, 4 hours of work a week, and 1 hour workshop or seminar each month.</li>
